                A truly majestic creature, that is quite literally a combination of a lion and a tiger, hence their name
                "Liger." And if I am being honest, I don't even know if this animal is real. I watched <em>Napoleon
                Dynamite</em> multiple times as a child and whenever asks me about animals, a liger i the first and only
                thing on my mind.
